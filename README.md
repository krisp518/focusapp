<h2>About</h2>
This project allows users to upload an image from their gallery as well as type in a message that will be displayed. I made this project because I would often get distracted by going on my phone and needed a kind reminder as to why I work. 

<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>
 I wanted to at least learn how to create and successfully create an Android app, learn how to display user-submitted images, learn how to display text, and learn how to control hardware components with software (this did not happen). There was no project requirement, just something that would amount to 2 months of work.

 <h3>Sprint Goal</h3>
<strong>FINISH IMAGE FUNCTION (THIS CAME TRUE) </strong><br/>

<h2>Key learnings</h2>
I learned how to navigate and use Android Studio IDE, android app UI and layout, some java code related to making functions run, and how important importing libraries were. Sprint goal taught me how much I could accomplish if I really locked in and honed into just one feasible goal. 

<h2>Running your project</h2>
To be honest, I am not yet sure because I installed my app through Android Studio. This will be something I will look into in the future. 

<h2>Misc.</h2>
